# Simple Automation Framework

http://theseleniumguys.com/framework-library/simple-automation-framework/

Here’s a simple automation framework that you can derive from just Visual Studio (VS) with C#, Selenium and the most popular browsers. Even something this simple will allow you to do cross-browser testing on your system.

###Components

**Visual Studio**: This is our chosen Integrated Development Environment (IDE) given we’re working primarily with C# and .NET technologies. Read about installing Visual Studio on your system in our Basics section.

**Selenium**: Once VS is installed we can add the Selenium WebDriver package and WebDriver extensions for each browser using the NuGet Package Manager. That’s covered in the above Basics walk-through for VS too.

**Browsers**: Finally, you’ll need to install the most popular browsers. We have another Basics that covers setting-up the browsers shown.

Once you’ve done that, be sure to try out our [Weekly Code Drills](http://theseleniumguys.com/weekly-code-drills/) that can be done with this simple framework.
